/*
 * Problem:
 * Write a method that takes an integer input and determines if that inputted 
 * integer is a prime number (factors are only 1 and itself); the method should
 * return the corresponding boolean.
 * 
 * e.g. input of 7 would return true as its only factors are 1 and itself
 *      input of 12 would return false as it has other factors (12,6,4,3,2,1)
