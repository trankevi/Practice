/*
 * Problem:
 * Given an unsorted array of integers which has a number in the majority
 * (appears more than 50% in the array), write a method to find that number
 * 
 * e.g. int[] array = { 1, 3, 3, 4, 2, 3, 7, 3, 3 };
 * We would want the method to return 3 in this case as it appears 5/9 times.
